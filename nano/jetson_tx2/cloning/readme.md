   nano@e2:~/Downloads$ locate flash.sh
   /home/nano/Downloads/jetpack/64_TX2/Linux_for_Tegra/flash.sh
   nano@e2:~/Downloads$ cd /home/nano/Downloads/jetpack/64_TX2/Linux_for_Tegra/
   nano@e2:~/Downloads/jetpack/64_TX2/Linux_for_Tegra$
   ```

2. read APP partition from TX2 board and save image to file

   nano@e2:~/Downloads$ cd /home/nano/Downloads/jetpack/64_TX2/Linux_for_Tegra/
   nano@e2:~/Downloads/jetpack/64_TX2/Linux_for_Tegra$
